PHP Coding Standards Fixer
==========================

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool fixes *most* issues in your code when you
want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2
documents.

If you are already using ``PHP_CodeSniffer`` to identify coding standards
problems in your code, you know that fixing them by hand is tedious, especially
on large projects. This tool does the job for you.

Installation
------------

Locally
~~~~~~~

Download the `php-cs-fixer.phar`_ file and store it somewhere on your computer.

Globally (manual)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run these commands to easily access ``php-cs-fixer`` from anywhere on
your system:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo wget http://get.sensiolabs.org/php-cs-fixer.phar -O /usr/local/bin/php-cs-fixer

or with curl:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo curl http://get.sensiolabs.org/php-cs-fixer.phar -o /usr/local/bin/php-cs-fixer

then:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/php-cs-fixer

Then, just run ``php-cs-fixer``.

Globally (Composer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install PHP-CS-Fixer, install Composer and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./composer.phar global require fabpot/php-cs-fixer @stable

Then, make sure you have ``~/.composer/vendor/bin`` in your ``PATH``, and
you're good to go:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"

Globally (homebrew)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP-CS-Fixer is part of the homebrew-php project. Follow the installation
instructions at https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php if you don't
already have it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew tap josegonzalez/homebrew-php
    $ brew install php-cs-fixer

Update
------

Locally
~~~~~~~

The ``self-update`` command tries to update ``php-cs-fixer`` itself:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php php-cs-fixer.phar self-update

Globally (manual)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update ``php-cs-fixer`` through this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo php-cs-fixer self-update

Globally (homebrew)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update ``php-cs-fixer`` through this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew upgrade php-cs-fixer

Usage
-----

The ``fix`` command tries to fix as much coding standards
problems as possible on a given file or directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/dir
    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/file

The ``--level`` option limits the fixers to apply on the
project:

.. code-block:: bash

    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/project --level=psr0
    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/project --level=psr1
    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/project --level=psr2
    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/project --level=all

By default, all PSR-2 fixers and some additional ones are run.

The ``--fixers`` option lets you choose the exact fixers to
apply (the fixer names must be separated by a comma):

.. code-block:: bash

    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/dir --fixers=linefeed,short_tag,indentation

You can also blacklist the fixers you don't want if this is more convenient,
using ``-name``:

.. code-block:: bash

    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/dir --fixers=-short_tag,-indentation

A combination of ``--dry-run``, ``--verbose`` and ``--diff`` will
display summary of proposed fixes, leaving your files unchanged.

The command can also read from standard input, in which case it won't
automatically fix anything:

.. code-block:: bash

    cat foo.php | php php-cs-fixer.phar fix -v --diff -

Choose from the list of available fixers:

* **indentation** [PSR-2] Code must use 4 spaces for indenting, not
  tabs.

* **linefeed** [PSR-2] All PHP files must use the Unix LF
  (linefeed) line ending.

* **trailing_spaces** [PSR-2] Remove trailing whitespace at the end of
  lines.

* **unused_use** [all] Unused use statements must be removed.

* **phpdoc_params** [all] All items of the @param phpdoc tags must be
  aligned vertically.

* **short_tag** [PSR-1] PHP code must use the long <?php ?> tags or
  the short-echo <?= ?> tags; it must not use the
  other tag variations.

* **return** [all] An empty line feed should precede a return
  statement.

* **visibility** [PSR-2] Visibility must be declared on all
  properties and methods; abstract and final must be
  declared before the visibility; static must be
  declared after the visibility.

* **php_closing_tag** [PSR-2] The closing ?> tag MUST be omitted from
  files containing only PHP.

* **braces** [PSR-2] Opening braces for classes, interfaces,
  traits and methods must go on the next line, and
  closing braces must go on the next line after the
  body. Opening braces for control structures must go
  on the same line, and closing braces must go on the
  next line after the body.

* **extra_empty_lines** [all] Removes extra empty lines.

* **function_declaration** [PSR-2] Spaces should be properly placed in a
  function declaration

* **include** [all] Include and file path should be divided with a
  single space. File path should not be placed under
  brackets.

* **controls_spaces** [all] A single space should be between: the closing
  brace and the control, the control and the opening
  parentheses, the closing parentheses and the opening
  brace.

* **psr0** [PSR-0] Classes must be in a path that matches their
  namespace, be at least one namespace deep, and the
  class name should match the file name.

* **elseif** [PSR-2] The keyword elseif should be used instead of
  else if so that all control keywords looks like
  single words.

* **eof_ending** [PSR-2] A file must always end with an empty line
  feed.


The ``--config`` option customizes the files to analyse, based
on some well-known directory structures:

.. code-block:: bash

    # For the Symfony 2.3+ branch
    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/sf23 --config=sf23

Choose from the list of available configurations:

* **default** A default configuration

* **magento** The configuration for a Magento application

* **sf23**    The configuration for the Symfony 2.3+ branch

The ``--dry-run`` option displays the files that need to be
fixed but without actually modifying them:

.. code-block:: bash

    php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/code --dry-run

Instead of using command line options to customize the fixer, you can save the
configuration in a ``.php_cs`` file in the root directory of
your project. The file must return an instance of
`Symfony\CS\ConfigInterface`, which lets you configure the fixers, the files,
and directories that need to be analyzed:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $finder = Symfony\CS\Finder\DefaultFinder::create()
        ->exclude('somedir')
        ->in(__DIR__)
    ;

    return Symfony\CS\Config\Config::create()
        ->fixers(array('indentation', 'elseif'))
        ->finder($finder)
    ;

You may also use a blacklist for the Fixers instead of the above shown whitelist approach.
The following example shows how to use all Fixers but the `Psr0Fixer`.
Note the additional ``-`` in front of the Fixer name.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $finder = Symfony\CS\Finder\DefaultFinder::create()
        ->exclude('somedir')
        ->in(__DIR__)
    ;

    return Symfony\CS\Config\Config::create()
        ->fixers(array('-Psr0Fixer'))
        ->finder($finder)
    ;

With the ``--config-file`` option you can specify the path to the
``.php_cs`` file.

Helpers
-------

Dedicated plugins exist for:

* `Vim`_
* `Sublime Text`_
* `NetBeans`_

Contribute
----------

The tool comes with quite a few built-in fixers and finders, but everyone is
more than welcome to `contribute`_ more of them.

Fixers
~~~~~~

A *fixer* is a class that tries to fix one CS issue (a ``Fixer`` class must
implement ``FixerInterface``).

Configs
~~~~~~~

A *config* knows about the CS level and the files and directories that must be
scanned by the tool when run in the directory of your project. It is useful for
projects that follow a well-known directory structures (like for Symfony
projects for instance).
